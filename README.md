# Best Route - Approach and Assumptions

## Approach
This solution finds the optimal route for a delivery executive to pick up orders from multiple restaurants and deliver them to consumers while minimizing total time. The approach consists of:

1. Generating all valid pickup and delivery sequences
2. Simulating each sequence by calculating total travel time and waiting time while eliminating wrong sequences.
3. Keeping track of the sequence with the minimum time along with the route followed.

Note:
- Right now, both pickup and delivery sequences are stored together, with indices differentiating them, and invalid sequences are eliminated using a pickup flag. This could be improved by explicitly separating pickup and delivery sequences for better clarity.
- The program uses the Haversine formula to compute distances and assumes a constant travel speed of 20 km/h, converting all times to whole minutes.
- I've picked the Haversine distance and radian calculations based on standard formulas available online.

## Assumptions
- Prep time is given in whole minutes.
- Travel time is rounded up to ensure realistic time calculations.
- The number of orders should match the number of consumers.

## Next Steps & Potential Improvements

- More Efficient Route Calculation: Right now, we brute-force through all possible sequences, which works for small inputs but isnâ€™t scalable. Exploring smarter algorithms like A search* or branch and bound could help.
- Prioritize Certain Deliveries: Some orders, like hot food, might need to be delivered first. Adding priority-based logic could make the system smarter.
- Support More Flexible Order Handling: In the real world, a delivery executive might have more orders than consumers (or vice versa). Extending the solution to handle these cases would make it more robust.
